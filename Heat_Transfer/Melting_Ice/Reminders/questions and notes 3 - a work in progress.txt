MOAR QUESTIONS


Ability to change parameters while paused - intended or glitch? (I think it's a glitch)
"Situation ___ melted ___g of ice in ___ seconds" doesn't display--should it?
"About" text
	--> look over
	--> contact whom?
likewise, info at bottom of page
	--> look over
	--> contact whom?
	--> copyright?
randomly move ice cubes back and forth - necessary?
Should ice blocks disappear? It seems to be calibrated so that the block temp will never
	reach 0 anyway.











NOTES



tinit1 = temp1
m1 = mass1
cp1 = heatCapacity1
a1 = area1
number1 = numBlocks1
u1 = stirFactor1

tenv = icewaterTemp
t1 = currentBlockTemp1
intl = secondsPerStep


intl is the number of seconds represented by each calculation/"step"
intl = tau/200 (always 200 calcs)


icemelttoth1 = the amount the ice's height needs to shrink
icemelttow1 = the amount the ice's width needs to shrink
(for the sit w/ the higher q, icemelttoth and icemelttow should be equal to the
ice's height/width, respectively)


t1disp and t1rem you don't use for anything




max value of x-axis appears to be taus truncated to an integer
after hitting water, blocks move 1 pixel per calculation/"step"
appears to be 20 steps / second, or steps take 50ms each
