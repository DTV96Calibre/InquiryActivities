MOAR QUESTIONS

*Should* the mass be allowed to be 0?
Graph scaling
Ice water temperature?
x-axis labels change right away, but y-axis labels don't change till blocks are dropped
So it seems to calibrate it so that the block will always reach 0C by the time the ice is completely melted (so there will never be energy left over to bring the temp above 0), correct?



Important frames:
1 (top)

(4 for how to move the blocks)



NOTES

u1 = 0.03
u2 = 0.03
tenv = 0
taunumber = 5



t1 = block temp 1			Things that involve temperature:
m1 = mass 1				t1 = current block temp?
cp1 = heat capacity 1			tinit1 = user's input of initial block temp?
a1 = area 1				t1disp
number1 = num blocks 1
u1 =  0.1 if stir bar is visible;
	0.03 if no stir bar


tau1/tau2 are calculated
taunumber is 5
taus is taunumber times the bigger of tau1/tau2


intl is the number of seconds represented by each calculation/"step"
intl = tau/200 (always 200 calcs)


icemelttoth1 = the amount the ice's height needs to shrink
icemelttow1 = the amount the ice's width needs to shrink
(for the sit w/ the higher q, icemelttoth and icemelttow should be equal to the
ice's height/width, respectively)


t1disp and t1rem you don't use for anything
tenv = icewater temp?




max value of x-axis appears to be taus truncated to an integer
after hitting water, blocks move 1 pixel per calculation/"step"
